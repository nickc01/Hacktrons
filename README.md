# Hacktrons #

Hacktrons is a turn-based strategy game made for college class. It is based on an old Lego game called Spybotics: The Nightball Incident, and I decided to build a recreation of it within the span of two weeks. The first week was mostly focused on making a trailer for the game (since the class required that too), and the second week was focused on finishing a workable verison of the game. In the game, you play as a CIA agent, defeating viruses in network nodes by uploading programs to destroy them. When it's your turn, you can move each of your programs around a map, and if they are near an enemy, you can attack them. Once all of your programs have done their moves, then it will switch to the enemy's turn, and they have the ability to attack you. This goes back and forth until you or the enemy looses all of their programs.
